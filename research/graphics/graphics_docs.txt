// OVERVIEW
///////////////////////

This document will outline my endeavor to figure out a few things. 
First off, I need to learn how to program in openGL. Secondly, I need to learn how to
port this knowledge over to OpenGL ES, and use it to render a 3d space with coordinate information 
supplied by the sonar system.

// NOTES

////////////////////////
// OPENGL
////////////////////////
It seems as though you can harness openGL through a variety of languages. There's
libraries written for every language imaginable, C, C++, Java, Python. The particular 
flavor of OpenGL that's used by Andriod is OpenGL ES.

////////////////////////
// OPENGL ES
////////////////////////

If we follow the reasoning behind the previous paragraph and what I know 
so far, this means that OpenGL ES for Andriod will use a Java-based API
for drawing things. I think this means that there shouldn't be any extra frameworks
that I have to install. There's a whole package known as android.opengl devoted 
to open GL rendering.

// VERSION CONFUSION
It seems as though OpenGL ES 3.0 is the most recent version of OGL - however there's some devices 
that don't support it. We may have to use the archaic OpenGL ES 2.0...

Either way, in order to pick a version, we have to add this line to our AndroidManifest.xml file:

<uses-feature android:glEsVersion="0x00030000" android:required="true" />
[this is for version 3.0]

// THE API

At this point, most of the API documentation is gibberish to me. I need some
foundational OpenGL knowledge before the API makes sense. I'll devote the next section to learning some basic OpenGL.

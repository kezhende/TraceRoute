Presentation: The Core Concepts

Be conservative with the technical details, focus on what we learned.


FOCAL POINTS:

I - 

II - ENHANCED NAVIGATION WITH BEACONS
Although pedestrian dead reckoning with just the device can be unreliable, there's
a huge potential to enhance the capabilities by using wifi or other wireless signals
to correct for compounding navigational errors.

- NAVIGATION WITHOUT GPS
The focus of TraceRoute is for interior navigation. We want to produce an app
that gives clear and reliable navigation data inside of buildings, where GPS can't be used.
We're striving to get the navigational system to be as accurate or more accurate than GPS.
The GPS uses lots of power, so this can provide a lower power alternative to GPS navigation as well.

II - What we did
- We made an application that fufills the basic requirement. 

- Problems still present with the application.

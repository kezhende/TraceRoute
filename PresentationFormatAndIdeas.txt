Presentation: The Core Concepts

Professor Gollagotaka said that the presentation is supposed to be a 3 minute 'pitch'.
Be conservative with the technical details, and focus on the potential that this technology has.

FOCAL POINTS:

I - NAVIGATION WITHOUT GPS
The focus of TraceRoute is for interior navigation. We want to produce an app
that gives clear and reliable navigation data inside of buildings, where GPS can't be used.
We're striving to get the navigational system to be as accurate or more accurate than GPS.

The GPS uses lots of power, so this can provide a lower power alternative to GPS navigation as well.

II - ENHANCED NAVIGATION WITH BEACONS
Although pedestrian dead reckoning with just the device can be unreliable, there's
a huge potential to enhance the capabilities by using wifi or other wireless signals
to correct for compounding navigational errors.

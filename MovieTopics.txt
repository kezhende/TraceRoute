TECH TOPICS FOR THE VIDEO

This will serve as a narrative script for our video.

------------I - Sensors-------------
- Discuss the drawbacks of each sensor.

- Discuss the sensor fusion demo and corrective algorithm.
 
- Talk about what role each sensor plays in helping us
navigate

------------II Navigation------------
- Introduce the concept of pedestrian dead reckoning 

- Talk about the major problems present with our
current application. 

- Discuss the different methods of navigation that we pondered 
(integrating acceleration vector vs. step counting. Compass vs. Gyroscope, ect.)

- Discuss future developemnts (bluetooth beacons, wifi backscatter, ect.)


------------III OpenGL ES------------
- Quick introduction to OpenGL ES. 

- Discuss the shaders and diffuse lighting.

- Talk about panning and scrolling

------------IV Interface Design------------
- Talk about the difficulties of designing for a small screen.

Designing for a mobile screen is difficult - a typical 24" desktop display offers
plenty of room for an interface. Phones don't have that luxury. Every centimeter counts - 
We needed maximum functionality with minimal clutter.  

- Design mock-up

As we made progress, our interface became crowded with
debugging menus and special settings. We needed to consolidate what 
was important into an intuitive, streamlined interface. We created 
a crude design mock-up in paint that illistrated the desired application 
structure. In interface design, it's important to present the user
with as little noise as possible. We tried to minimize the amount
of interactive objects on the main screen, and we made sure that
everything was marked with a picture. Additionally, we organized menus in 
a way that minimizes work required to change user-desireable settings.

The introductory screen consists of an interactive 3-d model, a menu bar, and a "play"
button. When the play button is pressed, the application begins recording the user's path.
A 'save' bubble appears, which allows the user to save their path to the phone for
later viewing. 


One of the primary features we implemented for the sake of useability are floating icons:

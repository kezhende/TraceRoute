Collaberative Drawing
Uses google cardboard to have a community drawing board.
Feasible? Probably. Useful? Maybe.

SonarON?
Uses sonar to detect whether or not somebody is in bed. An
alarm that's only active when somebody's in bed. Uses sonar to detect
movement I like this idea. 
Feasible? Yes. 

iSwitch
Turn off devices by looking at them. Uses an AR headset to detect what
you're looking at. Uses custom hardware to receive signal to shut a TV down.
Feasible? Yes, but this will require a lot of work across multiple devices,
and will require some algorithm design for recognising 
devices that have these recievers.
Useful? Yes, very. A good, non-intrusive AR application.

Talent/Service Locator?
Feasible? Yes, using AWS to post what jobs are needed. The GPS data is
reasonably accurate, so it should work reasonably well.
Useful? Probably. The exact goal of the application is
still unclear to me. 

Enhanced E-Reader - Use the device camera to blur areas of the screen where
you're not supposed to be looking. Uses some openCV and maching learning to 
do eye detection and appropriate screen blurring
Feasible: Yes. All of the tech here is reliable, and it's been
used in similar circumstances. 
Useful? Yes. It's has a focused purpose of increasing 

Name Recogniser - Putting names to faces. Uses the eye tracker
and camera to recognise faces. Uses openVR and openCV. Pulls data
from social networks to help in face recognition. Uses an interface
on the laptop to tell professors what it thinks the face you're looking
at is.

Feasible? Most likely. This is really experimental stuff, but
it's promising.

Useful? Yes, in a classroom setting. It has some scary implications
outside of the classroom, though.

Automatic Unlocker using the cell phone - 
Feasible? Yes. NFC technology is well delveloped. The only problem
with this is the propriary lock technology. This has some security concerns 
as well, since your phone can unlock things without unlocking the phone itself.

Cloud Gaming Service -
Stream your games online. Play local multiplayer games online.

 

Useful? Yes

Research Article that uses sonar to map the shape of a room:
http://www.pnas.org/content/110/30/12186.full

This approach requires 4 microphones to work.
Currently, it does not seem as if room mapping has been done with just two microphones on a smartphone.

There is a research paper in the same folder that documents range sensing with a single microphone.
This approach uses a pulse encoded with a specific signature and by measuring the time lapse between pulse generation the collection of the echo it can determine the distance.

With two microphones we can get information about the direction but only on a 2D plane.

At this point it does not seem feasible to create a 3D mapping with sonar on a smartphone.

--WHAT'S CURRENTLY WORKING
- The sensor screen displays all sensor values as it gets updated.
- The OpenGL view is displaying a 3d axis depending on the phone's rotation
- We have buttons on the openGL view for getting the user's preferences.

--WHAT'S IN PROGRESS

--OPENGL VIEW
-Drawing a 3d shape for extra perspective and debugging of the 3d view.
-Drawing rectangular prisms for use in drawing the 3d path.
-Stitching together rectangular prisms to form a path shape.

-Follow the user as they move through an interior.
-Rotate and manipulate the model based on touch gestures.
- Have a button that switches between 'follow' mode and 'free' mode,
where the user can control the camera.

--SENSOR VIEW


--WHAT'S DICKED
- The sensor display screen doesn't display properly on a Galaxy S5 screen.
- The OpenGL pane wigs out when the sensors give it bad values. We need to figure out how
to ignore those values or to smooth it somehow.

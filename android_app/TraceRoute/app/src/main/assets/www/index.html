<h1>TraceRoute</h1>
<div id="motivation">
    The motivation for this application was actually a nightmare. No seriously. Keith saw himself stuck in a cave tracing
    his steps over and over again, but ending up in the same place. So he envisioned TraceRoute an application that would
    allow for you to retrace your steps with higher accuracy.
